In this project, we observed how the intensity of sound waves is manipulated through different acoustic lenses. Four lenses were printed via a 3D printer, and the COMSOL Multiphysics simulation tool was used for the theoretical data.In this project, we observed how the intensity of sound waves is manipulated through different acoustic lenses.
